.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsshare\fR is used to view SLURM share information.  This command is
only viable when running with the priority/multifactor plugin.
The sshare information is derived from a database with the interface
being provided by \fBslurmdbd\fR (SLURM Database daemon) which is
read in from the slurmctld and used to process the shares available

Account, User, Raw Shares, Normalized Shares, Raw Usage, Normalized
Usage, Effective Usage, and the Fair-share factor for each association.
